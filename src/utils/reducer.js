/**
 * Reducer is just a simple function which takes an array of real numbers and returns a representative number by
 * reducing the array. A reducer can only be applied on a measure. When `groupBy` is applied on a DataModel, it
 * performs aggregation on all measures with a reducer function. Reducer function for a measure can be set from schema
 * or it can be overridden when `groupBy` is called.
 *
 * DataModel provides reducers which can be used out of the box
