      content: "DataModel\n\nReducer is just a simple function which takes an array of real numbers and returns a representative number by\nreducing the array. A reducer can only be applied on a measure. When `groupBy` is applied on a DataModel, it\nperforms aggregation on all measures with a reducer function. Reducer function for a measure can be set from schema\nor it can be overridden when `groupBy` is called.\n\nDataModel provides reducers which can be used out of the box\n <table>\n     <tr>\n         <th>Reducer Name</th>\n         <th>Description</th>\n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n         <td>sum</td>\n         <td>returns the sum of all the number</td>\n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n         <td>avg</td>\n         <td>returns the avg of all the number</td>\n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n         <td>min</td>\n         <td>returns the minimum of all the number</td>\n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n         <td>max</td>\n         <td>returns the maximum of all the number</td>\n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n         <td>first</td>\n         <td>returns the first number in an array</td>\n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n         <td>last</td>\n         <td>returns the last number in an array</td>\n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n         <td>count</td>\n         <td>returns number of elements in the array</td>\n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n         <td>variance</td>\n         <td>returns the variance of the numbers from the mean</td>\n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n         <td>std</td>\n         <td>returns the standard deviation of the numbers</td>\n     </tr>\n </table>\n\n```\n// An function to calculate mean squared value of an array.\nfunction (arr) {\n     const squaredVal = arr.map(item => item * item);\n     let sum = 0;\n     for (let i = 0, l = squaredVal.length; i < l; i++) {\n         sum += squaredVal[i];\n     }\n\n     return sum;\n }\n```"
